# global_plastic_pollution
An analysis of global plastic pollution, using 2016 data from World Bank and Our World in Data.

## Technologies
This project was completed using:
* Excel
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings
* 41% of the world's plastic waste is generated by just three countries: China, India, and the United States
* India generates roughly 25% of the world's mismanaged waste, which causes the most harm to the environment, natural wildlife, and public health.
* The United States is the only High Income country in the top 10 countries who produce the most mismanaged waste.
* Both India and the United States represent key areas where effective plastic waste management can have the biggest impact.
